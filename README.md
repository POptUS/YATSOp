## Yet Another Test Set for Optimization

YATSOp consists of a set of nonlinear optimization problems induced by the solution of systems of (non)linear equations. The defining feature of these problems is that they are of variable input dimension (i.e., the number of decision parameters). This facilitates testing across large ranges of such dimensions.

This page (and perhaps the set) is heavily under construction.
